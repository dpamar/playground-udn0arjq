# BrainFuck part 8 - JS/C#/BF Multi quine

The goal of this playground is to create a _multi quine_ in BF, but also Javascript and C#

At the end of this playground, you should be able to
* create a multi quine for {CS, JS, BF} language set
* create your own multi quine for any language set, or extends this one

Have fun !
